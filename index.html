# Notes of Lecture-1
## Differences between algorithm and model
**Algorithm**: A series of **definite steps or rules** which are used for specific problems or tasks. How to derive output from input is noted in algorithms.
**Model**: The **mathematical expression** of data which is gained by training algorithm and learning from data. The purpose of model is to predict or sort new data using old data.
A*lgorithms are usually used to train models.*
# Learning Plan
## For each week, spend more than *4 extra hours* in learning.
## For homework, often communicate with *partners* to promote the study of each other.
## Form the habit of *documenting*.
